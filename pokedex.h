// Add a new Pokemon to the Pokedex.
// Note: just adding the Pokemon to the Pokedex does not mean it has
// been 'found'.
//
// The new Pokemon should be added to the end of the Pokedex (i.e.
// directly after the Pokemon that was added when add_pokemon was last
// called).
//
// When the first Pokemon is added to the Pok�dex, the currently
// selected Pokemon becomes this Pokemon.
//
// The currently selected Pokemon remains the first Pokemon that was
// inserted into the Pokedex, until the `change_current_pokemon`,
// `next_pokemon`, or `prev_pokemon` functions are called.
//
// If there is already a Pokemon in the Pokedex with the same pokemon_id
// as this Pokemon, the function should print an appropriate error
// message and exit the program.
//
// Pokedex Order:
// --------------
// The Pokemon in the Pokedex are stored in the order in which they were
// added, i.e. the first Pokemon in the Pokedex will be the first
// Pokemon that was added, the second Pokemon in the Pokedex will be the
// second Pokemon that was added etc, and the last Pokemon in the
// Pokedex will be the Pokemon that was added most recently.
//
// For example, if Pikachu (#025) was added into an empty Pokedex, the
// Pokedex would now contain Pikachu at the start of the list, and
// Pikachu would be the currently selected Pokemon.
//
// [Start of Pokedex]
// #025: Pikachu <-- currently selected Pokemon
// [End of Pokedex]
//
// If Squirtle (#007) was then added, it would be the second Pokemon in
// the Pokedex, after Pikachu. The currently selected Pokemon would
// remain Pikachu.
//
// [Start of Pokedex]
// #025: Pikachu <-- currently selected Pokemon
// #003: Squirtle
// [End of Pokedex]
//
// If Diglett (#050) was then added, it would be the third Pokemon in the
// Pokedex, after Squirtle.
//
// [Start of Pokedex]
// #025: Pikachu <-- currently selected Pokemon
// #003: Squirtle
